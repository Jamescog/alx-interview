# Minimum Operations to get n H's in a Text File

Given a text file containing a single character H, and the ability to perform only two operations - Copy All and Paste - the task is to find the minimum number of operations required to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

## Approach

The approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start with a single H, and keep pasting it until the number of H's in the file reaches the target value n. If n is even, we divide it by 2 in each iteration, and if n is odd, we decrement it by 1. We keep track of the number of operations performed, and return the result when n reaches the target value.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), as each iteration reduces the number of H's by half (or by 1), and the maximum number of iterations is log n.

## Intuition

The intuition behind this solution is that each paste operation doubles the number of H's in the file, so we can reach the target value n in log n operations by dividing the number of H's by 2 in each iteration. If n is odd, we decrement it by 1 to make it even, and then continue the division process.

## Code 

```
    def minOperations(n):
    """
    Given a number n, this function calculates the fewest number of operations
    needed to result in exactly n H characters in a text file using only two operations:
    Copy All and Paste.
    
    If n is impossible to achieve, the function returns 0.
    
    :param n: an integer representing the target number of H characters
    :return: an integer representing the minimum number of operations required
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    while n != 1:
        operations += 1
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    
    return operations + 1

```
